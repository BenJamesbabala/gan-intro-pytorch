# Introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks
-------------------------------------------------

This repo is based on [John Glover's blog post](http://blog.aylien.com/introduction-generative-adversarial-networks-code-tensorflow/) about approximting a 1-dimensional Gaussian distribution using Generative Adversarial networks (GAN).

He also released [TensorFlow code](https://github.com/AYLIEN/gan-intro) for his experiments.

I tried to reimplement his experiments using Pytorch.
For this, I used some code from the [Pytorch DCGAN example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/dcgan/main.py).
